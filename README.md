#Hello there. 

I’m John Gray, an entrepreneur and software engineer. The post production company I founded, Wadjet, creates boutique audio description so people with visual impairments can enjoy vivid film and television.

In the course of running my business, I began programming automation tools to reduce days of menial office work to a single button press. To mitigate other forms of human suffering, I now create humanitarian software, including an app that enables low-vision users to access live film screenings. I also volunteer with Change Climate Project, building technical solutions that drive carbon reduction.

Outside of work, I love writing, reading, cooking, creating games and the San Francisco Giants. Born and live in New York.
