# John Gray
## Full Stack Software Developer

I am a software engineer designing and creating full stack applications and games. On an individual level, I enjoy coding because it allows me to exercise creativity, problem solving and organization. In collaboration, I am excited by the teamwork opportunities software engineering affords. The soft skills required to be a successful software engineer are skills Iâ€™ve cultivated throughout my life and career.

Over the past 5+ years, I've worked as a localization professional with a specialization in accessibility for the visually impaired. I used my extensive knowledge of the field to start my localization company, Wadjet LLC, where I work as an operations manager facilitating creation of varied enhancement and post-production deliverables. As a talent I've scripted and narrated 750+ hours of audio description.
